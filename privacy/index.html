Some of your personal information may be visible to other users of the Services (e.g., information featured on generally accessible parts of the contracts or on a user profile).

We encourage you to closely read each third-party website or third-party application privacy policy before sharing your personal information or otherwise interacting with them. Please note that we do not control, and we are not responsible for the third-party website’s or the third-party application’s processing of your personal information.</li> <li>Service Providers.

If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on our Services, by mail or by sending an email to you. </p> <p><strong><u>8. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</u></strong></p> <p>All information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including, but not limited to, the United States or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live.
